* Problem
Create your own stack functions to do the following:
 + List all the elements in the stack
 + Iterate through the stack and change one of the values based on its position

* Solution
 I simply used my array based implementation of a stack for this problem.
 + Listing all elements was straightforward, I just needed to go over the array
 with a for loop and just output every item.

 + Changing an element based on position was also straightforward, I just need to set the value of the array at a specific index to the new value assigned;
   #+BEGIN_SRC cpp
		void set_nth(const int n, const T& val){
			arr[n] = val;
		}
   #+END_SRC
