* Problem
 Test a stack's speed (with millions of operations) as to which is faster: an array based stack or a linked list based stack.

* Solution
 I first created a linked list based stack and an array based stack.
  -  Note: The linked list based stack pushes new node to the front, that way it's O(1) to push/pop. No need to traverse the entire list to get to the end.
 The array stack was straightforward, its constructor requires a maximum stack size. The stack can only have that many items maximum.


* Results
 Results for doing 10 million operations (both push and pop)
| Stack       | Time     |
|-------------+----------|
| Linked List | 1007 ms  |
| Array       | 543 ms   |
